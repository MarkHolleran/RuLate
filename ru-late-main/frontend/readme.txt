server.js and things in the app folder are from just messing around
with a previous tutorial to get node js connected to the database
    There are some placeholder stuff like anything referencing 'tutorial'
    that can be renamed.
    
Everything else can be ran using 'npm start'
    there you can see the react code working in the browser 
    
The next challenge is getting the server js to run the react code and getting the code to query the database to indicate a successful login
